Test, mock, intercept and modify Apollo Client's operations â€” in both browser and unit tests!

![Example recording output](./media/example-recording.png)

## Features

- **mock** responses in either unit tests or browser tests (think Puppeteer or Cypress)
  - simulate error state
  - simulate loading state
  - simulate subscriptions (pushing data to the client at any given point)
- it can work in production code without affecting the size of the bundle (laika is lazily loaded)
- captures the variables that were called for a given operation for assertions
- **log** all the data passing through from the network (or whatever Links are after this one)
- **record** your user story
- **generate fixtures and working mock code** for use in your tests
- **modify** backend responses before they reach your components (e.g. to fuzz-test unexpected behavior)
